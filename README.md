## üí° How It Works

1. **Clock In**: Start your work by clicking the "Clock In" button.
   - The system records the timestamp and disables the button to avoid duplicate entries.
2. **Clock Out**: End your work session by clicking the "Clock Out" button.
   - The system calculates the duration and updates the database.
3. **View Records**: Check your daily duration and recent clock-in/out history.
